mergedping is tool to ping multiple ip and say the first ip in list up

associated with route to an ip via a specific gateway, it allow check if path via an ISP is UP
Why just not do bash script for each gateway?
 - Have the event on gateway change
 - Prevent complicated route gateway parse
 - Just transmit the UP ip and deduce the working gateway to update dns
